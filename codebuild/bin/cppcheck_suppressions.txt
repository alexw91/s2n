// Reason: There are many Config options that aren't checked by Cppcheck, and it warns for each. Ignore these so that they don't clutter the output.

// cppcheck Message: (style:redundantAssignment) Variable 'mock_time' is reassigned a value before the old one has been used.
// Reason: s2n_config_set_monotonic_clock() takes a reference to mock_time so that whenever it's modified locally, the timer sees the update when it dereferences the pointer.

// cppcheck Message: (style:knownConditionTrueFalse) Condition 's2n_libcrypto_awslc_api_version()<17' is always true
// Reason: s2n_libcrypto_awslc_api_version() are implemented using macro's and for certain libcrypto's the preprocessor will produce a trivial function returning e.g. 1 always.

// cppcheck Message: (style:moduloofone) Modulo of one is always equal to zero.
// Reason: This test generates N^2 combinations of KEM preference orderings, with N=S2N_SUPPORTED_KEM_GROUPS_COUNT.
//         When compiled with Openssl 1.0.2, the only supported KEM is secp256r1_kyber-512-r3. A preference ordering of only that 1 KEM is still valid, and should still be tested.
//         The tests that do need a minimum of 2 KEM's in order to test fallback logic already have logic to detect S2N_SUPPORTED_KEM_GROUPS_COUNT==1 and will skip themselves.
